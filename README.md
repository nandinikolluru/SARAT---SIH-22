SARAT is a search and rescue aid tool which is used to find the drifted asset or personnel in seas and oceans.
The main purpose of SARAT is to find the lost AIRCRAFTS in oceans but it can also be used for domestic purposes. For Example , to trace out the lost rafts or humans in oceans.

SARAT takes the following parameters as inputs to search for a lost object,
1.Latitude
2.Longitude
3.Last Known Time 
4.Search Time
5.Object type(raft,machine,human etc)

The Main parameter SARAT considers is the wind speed and direction and ocean currents speed and direction.
By considering all the above parameters , SARAT predicts the trajectory of the lost asset.
